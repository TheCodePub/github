# Brief introduction to working with GitHub

## Your first Pull Request

Hooray! A pull request! But what's even a `Pull Request`? "Creating a pull request" is a fancy way of saying "suggesting a change". Pull Requests are what fuels the collaboration on GitHub. When you create a `Pull Request` (often abbreviated as `PR`), you've made an edit to something, and you're requesting that the owner of what you're editing reviews your change.

Say someone has published a list of great design books on GitHub:

```
- The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman
- On Web Typography by Jason Santa Maria
- Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski
- Don't Make Me Blink by Steve Krug
```

You notice a mistake in the last book title: it's actually "Don't Make me **Think**". If you want to suggest a change to fix the title, you would copy the list, and make the change:

```
- The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman
- On Web Typography by Jason Santa Maria
- Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski
- Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
```

You then create a pull requestâ€”a request to the owner of the list to "pull in" your changes. They can accept your change, whereupon it's saved into their version, or they can reject your suggestion. Every Pull Request also comes with a discussion thread where you can talk about why the change is a good (or bad) idea, and if there are any additional changes you need to make for the owner to accept it.

## Your challenge

We have a list of Code Pub Hackers who've created a Pull Request with the help of this guide: http://thecodepub.github.io. Your challenge is to add yourself to that list.

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Join TheCodePub
3. Clone the repository over at https://github.com/TheCodePub/thecodepub.github.io
4.
