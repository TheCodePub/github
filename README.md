# Brief introduction to working with GitHub

## Your first Pull Request

Hooray! A pull request! But what's even a `Pull Request`? "Creating a pull request" is the technical term for suggesting a change. When you collaborate with others on GitHub, Pull Requests are what fuels that collaboration. When you create a `Pull Request` (often abbreviated to `PR`), you've made an edit to something, and you're requesting that the owner of what you're editing reviews your change.

Say someone has published their favorite scones recipie on GitHub:

- 200g margarine or softened butter
- 200g sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 150g self-raising flour
- 50g cocoa
- 1tsp baking powder
- 1tsp vanilla extract
- 1 bowl of salt

You've tried it, but you've realized that the scones taste much better without the going crazy with the salt. If you want to suggest a change to the recipie, you would copy the recipie, and make the change:

- 200g margarine or softened butter
- 200g sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 150g self-raising flour
- 50g cocoa
- 1tsp baking powder
- 1tsp vanilla extract
- **1 pinch of salt**

You then create a pull requestâ€”a request to the owner to "pull in" your changes. They can accept your change, where upon it's saved into their version, or they can deny your change to be applied. Every pull request also comes with a discussion thread where you can talk about why the change is a good or bad idea, and what you could potentially change for your Pull Request to be accepted.
