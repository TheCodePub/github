# Introduction to GitHub

## Your first Pull Request

Hooray! A pull request! But what's even a `Pull Request`? "Creating a pull request" is a fancy way of saying "suggesting a change". Pull Requests are what fuels thecollaboration at GitHub. When you create a `Pull Request`, you've made an edit to something, and you're requesting that the owner of what you're editing reviews your change.

Say someone has published a list of great design books on GitHub:

```
- The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman
- On Web Typography by Jason Santa Maria
- Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski
- Don't Make Me Blink by Steve Krug
```

You notice a mistake in the last book title: it's actually "Don't Make Me **Think**". If you want to suggest a change to fix the title, you would copy the list, and make the change:

```
- The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman
- On Web Typography by Jason Santa Maria
- Mobile First by Luke Wroblewski
- Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
```

You then create a pull request—a request to the owner of the list to "pull in" your changes. They can accept your change, whereupon it's saved into their version, or they can reject your suggestion. Every Pull Request also comes with a discussion thread where you can talk about why the change is a good (or bad) idea, and if there are any additional changes you need to make for the owner to accept it.

## Your challenge

We have a list of Code Pub Hackers who've created a Pull Request with the help of this guide: http://thecodepub.github.io/hackers. Your challenge is to add yourself to that list. Ready? Great! Here's how you do it:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

1. Create a GitHub account
* Head over to https://desktop.github.com and download the GitHub app
* Install the app, and log in with your GitHub account
* Go back to your browser and head over to https://github.com/TheCodePub/thecodepub.github.io
* Clone the repository. Look for a button on the far right labeled "Clone in Desktop"

### Step 2: Add yourself to the list

1. In GitHub for Desktop, open the folder of the newly cloned repository by clicking on `Repository -> Open in Finder` (or press CMD+Shift+F)
* Locate and open the folder called `code-pub-hackers`
* You'll see a lot of files ending in `.md`. Make a duplicate out of one of them (anyone), and rename it to include your own name, like so: `[your-full-name].md`
* Open your file with a text editor
* Change the file to include your full name, your twitter if you have any, and today's date.
* Save the file
